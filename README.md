My stupid silly solutions to AoC2023

For some days I will add a 'doFirstOnly' variable at the top. Enabling this will perform day 1, disbaling this will perform day 2 (and day 1 depending on the prompt).
It depends on how I'm feeling on the day. If I think the prompt can be done easily by just addig code then I may as well print both solutions out! :D

Be sure to replace the file path names if you are snatching the code for yourself.
